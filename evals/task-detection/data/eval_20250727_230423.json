          "Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.",

Use the prev-prev summary. When saving active_tasks, make sure it conforms to the TaskWithSteps struct. Do not save the prompts or schemas in the json file, those will be loaded from elsewhere. Also, include a place for me to put the ground truth result (in this case, an array of step IDs) that I can fill out after the data has been saved to validate against.

By retirement, she’d taken down a president, ended the most violent strike in a generation, and built one of the best-performing companies in American history.\nGraham had no training, no experience, not even confidence. Just a newspaper bleeding money and a government that expected her to fall in line.\nPublic Release: July 29.\nMembers have\naccess now\nComing Soon:\nApple Podcasts | Spotify |\nWhen her editors brought her stolen classified documents, her lawyers begged her not to publish. They said it would destroy the company. She published them anyway. Nixon came after her, attacking her with the full force of the executive. Then Watergate. For nearly a year she was ridiculed and isolated while pursuing the story that would eventually bring down the president.\nGraham proved that you can grow into a job that initially seems impossible and no amount of training can substitute for having the right values and the courage to act on them.\nThis episode is for informational purposes only\nand is full of practical lessons I learned reading her memoir,\nPersonal History\nand watching\nBecoming Katharine Graham.\nLessons\nfrom Katharine Graham\nAddress and search bar\n\n",
