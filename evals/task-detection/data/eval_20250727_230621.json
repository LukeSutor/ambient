Use the text from the database. 2. use the formatted task string from format_tasks. 3. always maintain the 3 states in memory. 4. make it timestamp based, but also store timestamp data in the json file itself. Other notes: In the data to save for the eval, do not save the current screen state, as the current screen state would be used for the next task detection loop, and we're worried about the previous task detection loop (eg. if it had an error). Make sure you save the \"data\" in the screen states like the ApplicationTextData struct. Make sure the \"previous_summary\" isn't the immediate last summary saved in the database, as this will correspond to the summary that was generated from the previous task detection loop and is to be used in the next text detection loop. Use the prev-prev summary. When saving active_tasks, make sure it conforms to the TaskWithSteps struct. Do not save the prompts or schemas in the json file, those will be loaded from elsewhere. Also, include a place for me to put the ground truth result (in this case, an array of step IDs) that I can fill out after the data has been saved to validate against.
