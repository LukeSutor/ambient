COGNITO_USER_POOL_DOMAIN=https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_UFT2wBRqm

COGNITO_REGION=us-east-1

# IMPORTANT: You need to set up a domain in AWS Cognito Console
# 1. Go to AWS Cognito Console
# 2. Select your User Pool (us-east-1_UFT2wBRqm)
# 3. Go to "App integration" tab
# 4. In the "Domain name" section, create a domain prefix (e.g., "myapp-auth")
# 5. Replace COGNITO_USER_POOL_DOMAIN above with just the prefix (not the full URL)
# 
# Example: If you set up domain "myapp-auth", then:
# COGNITO_USER_POOL_DOMAIN=myapp-auth
# 
# The full URLs will be automatically constructed as:
# Auth URL: https://myapp-auth.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize
# Token URL: https://myapp-auth.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token
